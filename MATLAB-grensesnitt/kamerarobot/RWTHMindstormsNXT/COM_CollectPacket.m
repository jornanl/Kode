%
% Syntax
%   [type cmd statusbyte content] = COM_CollectPacket(handle)
%
%   [type cmd statusbyte content] = COM_CollectPacket(handle, 'dontcheck')
%
% Description
%   [type cmd statusbyte content] = COM_CollectPacket(handle) reads one packet on the communication
%   channel specified by the handle struct (PC system: handle struct containing e.g. serial
%   handle, Linux system: handle struct containing file handle). The USB / Bluetooth handle
%   struct can be obtained by the COM_OpenNXT or COM_GetDefaultNXT  command. The return
%   value type specifies the telegram type according to the LEGO Mindstorms communication
%   protcol. The cmd value determines the specific command. status indicates if an error
%   occured on the NXT brick. The function checkStatusByte is interpreting this information
%   per default. The content column vector represents the remaining payload of the whole return packet. E.g. it 
%   contains the current battery level in milli volts, that then has to be converted to a valid
%   integer from its byte representation (i.e. using wordbytes2dec). 
%
%   [type cmd statusbyte content] = COM_CollectPacket(handle, 'dontcheck') disables the validation
%   check of the status value by function checkStatusBytes.
%
%               varargin : set to 'dontcheck' if the status byte should not
%                          automatically be checked. Only use this if you
%                          expect error messages. Possible usage is for
%                          LSGetStatus, where this can happen...
%
%   For more details about the syntax of the return packet see the LEGO Mindstorms communication protocol.
%
% Note:
%
%   This function uses the specific Bluetooth settings from the ini-file
%   that was specified when opening the handle. Parameters used here are
%   SendSendPause and SendReceivePause, which will cause this function
%   to wait a certain amount of milliseconds between each consecutive send
%   or receive operation to avoid packet loss or buffer overflows inside
%   the blutooth stack.
%
% Example
%   COM_MakeBTConfigFile();
%
%   handle = COM_OpenNXT('bluetooth.ini', 'check');
%
%   [type cmd] = name2commandbytes('KEEPALIVE');
%   content = [];  % no payload in NXT command KEEPALIVE
%   packet = COM_CreatePacket(type, cmd, 'reply', content);
%
%   COM_SendPacket(packet, handle);
%
%   [type cmd statusbyte content] = COM_CollectPacket(handle);
%   % Now you could check the statusbyte or interpret the content.
%   % Or maybe check for valid type and cmd before...

    %      UPDATE: It seems that the above mentioned check may not be the
    %      best solution after all. When calling fread() with a certain
    %      amount of n bytes to read, it will wait the specified time out
    %      period until data has arrived. If not we get the warning
    %      mentioned below. The whole concept has to be carefully tweaked
    %      or maybe even adapted for high-quality and low-quality bluetooth
    %      environments...
    %
    %NOTE Note that we get a message on the command window from fread() 
    %     when this happens. It's not a "real" warning, but it says:
    %     "Warning: The specified amount of data was not returned within the Timeout period."
    %
    % Basically we can say at this point, that the bluetooth connection is
    % not working properly, if BT_CollectPacket() was called correctly
    % (after a packet was requested). This also seems the point where
    % packet loss can occur (or already HAS occured, and we can detect it).
    % Also fread() seems to hang (aka wait) the specified TimeOut period,
    % until it continues execution. If no data has arrived until then, we
    % get this "Warning: ..." message printed...
