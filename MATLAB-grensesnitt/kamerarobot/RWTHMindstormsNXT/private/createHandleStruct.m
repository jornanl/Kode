function h = createHandleStruct()
% Main part of the toolbox's NXT handle concept, creates a handle
%
% Syntax
%   h = createHandleStruct()
%
% Description
%   Various information concerning the NXT brick and the toolbox's way of
%   communicating with it is stored inside this handle: Bluetooth and USB
%   parameters, the actual handle to the hardware drivers, but also data
%   about the current motor status and transmission statistics.
%
%   To store dynamic information, we create this struct with function
%   handles to nested functions of this m-file, using the concept of
%   function closures. They enable us to keep variables as if they were
%   global or persistent, and work around the limitation of MATLAB that
%   passing variables/objects by reference is not possible...
%
%   For documentation of the provided "member functions" (function handles
%   to nested functions) see either this sourcecode or the "RWTH -
%   Mindstorms NXT Toolbox Developer's Guide" document (to be published)
% 
% Notes
%   Special thanks to Eckhard Lehmann (The MathWorks, Germany) for pointing
%   out and explaining the concept of function closures in MATLAB, as well
%   as thanks to Jim Hunziker for his example on this topic (from MATLAB
%   Central File Exchange).
%   Another good introductory example can be found here (especially comments
%   #3 and #6):
