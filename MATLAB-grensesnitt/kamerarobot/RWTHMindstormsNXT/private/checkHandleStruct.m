function checkHandleStruct(h)
% Private helper to check the integrity of an NXT handle struct
%
% Syntax
%   checkHandleStruct(h)
%
% Description
%   This functions tries to validate a given handle-struct. It get's called
%   before using a handle by the communication layer, or before setting a
%   default handle. Of course the functions cannot check all aspects, so
%   deliberate manipulations of handles can still lead to crashes (this is
%   expected).
%   The function does not return a value but raises an error if
%   appropriate.

% this whole function is somewhat, hmmm... "useless"?
% we can never check the integrity of a full handle, that would be far to
% complex to check all function pointers, handles, numbers, etc.
% on the other hand, if we cannot check all properties and check only a few
% of them, we could reduce this to just one (faster) check...
% well, whatever, this seems like a fair trade-off right now.

% but still, if someone messes around with a handle, there's not much we
% can do about it. but it will produce error messages sooner or later
% anyway.
