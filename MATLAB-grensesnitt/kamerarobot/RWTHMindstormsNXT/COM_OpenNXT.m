function handle = COM_OpenNXT(varargin)
% Opens a USB or Bluetooth connection to an NXT device and returns a handle for future use
%
% Syntax
%   handle = COM_OpenNXT()
%
%   handle = COM_OpenNXT(inifilename, 'check')
%
% Description
%   handle = COM_OpenNXT() tries to open a connection via USB. The first
%   NXT device that is found will be used. Device drivers (Fantom on
%   Windows, libusb on Linux) have to be already installed for USB to work.
%
%   handle = COM_OpenNXT(inifilename, 'check') will search the USB bus
%   for NXT devices, just as the syntax without any parameters. If this fails
%   for some reason (no USB connection to the NXT available, no device drivers
%   installed, or NXT device is busy), the function will try to establish a 
%   connection via Bluetooth, using the given Bluetooth configuration file
%   (you can create one easily with COM_MakeBTConfigFile. The optional
%   paramter 'check' can be omitted, but that is not recommended (as it detects errors with the
%   Bluetooth connection outside MATLAB right away). For more information
%   about this 'check'-option, see the documentation on NXT_CloseNXTEx.
%
%  
%   Note that this function is the most simple way to get an NXT handle. If
%   you need a method to access multiple NXTs or more options, see the
%   advanced function COM_OpenNXTEx. In fact, COM_OpenNXT is just a
%   convenient wrapper to COM_OpenNXTEx('Any', ...).
%
%
% Limitations of COM_CloseNXT
%   If you call COM_CloseNXT('all') after a clear all command has been
%   issued, the function will not be able to close all remaining open USB
%   handles, since they have been cleared out of memory. This is a problem
%   on Linux systems. You will not be able to use the NXT device without
%   rebooting it.
%   Solution: Either use only clear in your programs, or you use the
%   COM_CloseNXT('all') statement before clear all.
%   The best way however is to track your handles carefully and close them
%   manually (COM_CloseNXT(handle)) before exiting whenever possible!
%
%
% Example
%   handle = COM_OpenNXT('bluetooth.ini', 'check');
%   COM_SetDefaultNXT(handle);
%   NXT_PlayTone(440,10);
%   COM_CloseNXT(handle);
