% Syntax
%   ReturnBytes = COM_ReadI2C(Port, RequestLen, DeviceAddress, RegisterAddress)
%
%   ReturnBytes = COM_ReadI2C(Port, RequestLen, DeviceAddress, RegisterAddress, handle)
%
% Description
%    This function is used to retrieve data from digital sensors (like the
%    ultrasonic) in a comfortable way. It is designed as a helping function
%    for developers wanting to access new sensors. For already implemented
%    sensors (e.g. ultrasound, as well as HiTechnic's acceleration and 
%    infrared sensors), use the provided high-level functions such as
%    GetUltrasonic, GetInfrared, etc.
%
%    For I2C communication, usually the NXT_SetInputMode command has to
%    be used with the LOWSPEED_9V or LOWSPEED setting. Afterwards,
%    commands can be send with NXT_LSWrite. Once a sensor is correctly
%    working, i.e. has data available, you can use this function to
%    retrieve them.
%
%    In COM_ReadI2C(Port, RequestLen, DeviceAddress, RegisterAddress),
%    Port is the sensor-port the sensor is connected to. RequestLen
%    specifies the amount of bytes you want to retrieve. For ultasound,
%    this is 1. DeviceAddress is the sensor's address on the I2C bus.
%    This sometimes can be changed, but not for the ultrasonic sensor.
%    Default value is 0x02 (2 in decimal). Finally, RegisterAddress is
%    the address where you want to read data from. For the ultrasound and
%    many other sensors, the "data section" starts at 0x42 (66 in decimal).
%
%    As last argument you can pass a valid NXT-handle to be used by this
%    function. If no handle is passed, the default set by
%    COM_SetDefaultNXT will be used.
%
%    *Returns:* ReturnBytes, byte-array (column vector) of uint8.
%    This array contains the raw sensor-data you requested. How to
%    interpret them depends on the sensor. If communication failed (even
%    after automatic retransmission) -- e.g. when the sensor get's
%    disconnected while in use -- an empty vector [] will be returned.
%
% Note:
%
%    Please note that the return values of this function are of type uint8.
%    You have to convert them to double (using double()) before
%    performing calculations with them, otherwise you might get unexpected
%    results!
%
%    The sensor you are addressing with this command has to be correctly
%    opened and initialized of course -- otherwise no valid data can be
%    received.
%
% Example
%    This example opens and reads the ultrasonic sensor
%   port = SENSOR_1;
%   handle = COM_OpenNXT('bluetooth.ini', 'check');
%
%   OpenUltrasonic(port);
%
%   % retrieve 1 byte from device 0x02, register 0x42
%   data = COM_ReadI2C(port, 1, uint8(2), uint8(66));
%
%   if isempty(data)
%       DistanceCM = -1;
%   else
%       % don'f forget this double()!!!
%       DistanceCM = double(data(1));
%   end%if

%% Build hex command and send it with NXT_LSWrite

%% Try requesting answer until it is ready

    % Usually one should issue the LSWrite command, then keep requesting
    % the I2C bus-status with LSGetStatus until it doesn't return an error
    % and until the amount of bytes one requested is availabled, and then
    % finally retrieve the data with LSRead.
    %
    % I found that the step with LSGetStatus can be omitted. Each direct
    % command, including LSRead, has its own error message included (the
    % statusbyte). If instead of using LSGetStatus and THEN using LSRead,
    % we just use LSRead straight ahead, this has 2 advantages:
    % - most of the time, the I2C sensor is ready anyway. So we save the
    % time (especially via Bluetooth) that LSGetStatus needs.
    % - if the sensor is not ready, we can keep polling it with LSRead. The
    % error messages are the same, but once they stop (and data is ready),
    % we already got the data as payload - having saved another call!
    %
    % Compared to the traditional way, this yields a speed up of about 100%
    % for both Bluetooth and USB.
    %
    %
    % Note that there is a tiny chance for further improvement, depending
    % on the sensor. If we add a short pause here in the magnitude of 1ms
    % to 10ms, it could lead to one failed LSRead being saved. Imagine
    % this: Instead of asking the sensor straight away if it's ready, and
    % then waiting 60ms for one more Bluetooth packet to arrive, we could
    % wait 10ms (if that is enough) and then get the sensors answer with
    % the next packet straight away.
    % Testing showed that this is NOT necessary and most of the time NOT
    % helping with Bluetooth, a fast computer and the ultrasonic sensor.
    % However, different sensors may show different behaviour...
