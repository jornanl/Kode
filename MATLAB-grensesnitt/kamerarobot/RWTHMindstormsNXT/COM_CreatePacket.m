function bytes = COM_CreatePacket(CommandType, Command, ReplyMode, ContentBytes)
% Generates a valid Bluetooth packet ready for transmission (i.e. calculates length)
%
% Syntax
%   bytes = COM_CreatePacket(CommandType, Command, ReplyMode, ContentBytes)
%
% Description
%   bytes = COM_CreatePacket(CommandType, Command, ReplyMode, ContentBytes) creates a valid
%   Bluetooth packet conform to the LEGO Mindstorms communication protocol. The CommandType
%   specifies the telegram type (direct or system command (see the
%   LEGO Mindstorms communication protocol documentation for more details)). This type is determined
%   from the function name2commandbytes. The Command specifies the actual command according to
%   the LEGO Mindstorms communication protocol. By the ReplyMode one can request an
%   acknowledgement for the packet transmission. The two strings 'reply' and 'dontreply' are
%   valid. The content byte-array is given by the ContentBytes.
%
%   The return value bytes represents the complete Bluetooth packet conform to the LEGO Mindstorms
%   Communication protocol.
%
% Note:
%   The activated ReplyMode should only be used if it is necessary. According to the official
%   LEGO statement "Testing during development has shown that the Bluetooth Serial Port
%   communication has some disadvantages when it comes to streaming data. ... One problem is a time
%   penalty (of around 30ms) within the Bluecore chip when switching from receive-mode to
%   transmit-mode. ... To handle the problem of the time penalty within the Bluecore chip, users
%   should send data using Bluetooth without requesting a reply package. This will mean that the
%   Bluecore chip won't have to switch direction for every received package and will not incur a
%   30ms penalty for every data package."
%
% Example
%   [type cmd] = name2commandbytes('PLAYTONE');
%   content(1:2) = dec2wordbytes(frequency, 2);
%   content(3:4) = dec2wordbytes(duration, 2);
%
%   packet = COM_CreatePacket(type, cmd, 'dontreply', content);
