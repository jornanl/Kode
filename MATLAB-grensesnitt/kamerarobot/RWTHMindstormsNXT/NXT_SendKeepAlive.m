function [status SleepTimeLimit] = NXT_SendKeepAlive(ReplyMode, varargin)
% Sends a KeepAlive packet. Optional: requests sleep time limit.
%  
% Syntax
%   [status SleepTimeLimit] = NXT_SendKeepAlive(ReplyMode) 
%
%   [status SleepTimeLimit] = NXT_SendKeepAlive(ReplyMode, handle)
%
% Description
%   [status SleepTimeLimit] = NXT_SendKeepAlive(ReplyMode) sends a KeepAlive packet to the NXT
%   Brick to get the current sleep time limit of the Brick in milliseconds. By the ReplyMode
%   one can request an acknowledgement for the packet transmission. The two strings 'reply' and
%   'dontreply' are valid. status indicates if an error occures by the packet transmission.
%   Function checkStatusBytes is interpreting this information per default. The value
%   SleepTimeLimit contains the time in milliseconds after the NXT brick will turn off
%   automatically. The variable will only be set if ReplyMode is 'reply'. The sleep time limit
%   setting can only  be modified using the on-screen-menu on the brick itself.
%
%   Using 'dontreply' will just send a keep-alive packet. This means, the NXT internal counter when
%   to shut down automatically (this is a setting that can only be accessed directly on the NXT)
%   will be reset. This counter is not an inactivity counter: Bluetooth traffic will NOT stop the
%   NXT from turning off. E.g. if the sleep limit is set to 10 minutes, the only way to keep the NXT
%   Brick from turning off is to send a keep-alive packet within this time.
%
%   If you use replymode 'reply', SleepTimeLimit tells you the current setting on the brick, in
%   milliseconds. 0 means sleep timer is disabled. -1 is an invalid answer: You obviously didn't use
%   'reply' and still tried to get an answer.
% 
%   [status SleepTimeLimit] = NXT_SendKeepAlive(ReplyMode, handle) uses the given NXT
%   connection handle. This should be a struct containing a serial handle on a PC system and a file handle on a Linux
%   system. 
%
%   If no NXT handle is specified the default one (COM_GetDefaultNXT) is used.
%
%   For more details see the official LEGO Mindstorms communication protocol.
%
% Note:
%   This function is also used if you call COM_OpenNXT() with the optional 'check' parameter. Then
%   a keep-alive packet is send and the answer will be received to check for a correctly working
%   bidirectional bluetooth connection.
%
% Examples
%   [status SleepTimeLimit] = NXT_SendKeepAlive('reply');
%
%   NXT_SendKeepAlive('dontreply');
%
%   handle = COM_OpenNXT('bluetooth.ini','check');
%   [status SleepTimeLimit] = NXT_SendKeepAlive('reply', handle);
