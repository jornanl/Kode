function snaps = USGetSnapshotResults(port, varargin)
% Retrieves up to eight echos (distances) stored inside the US sensor
%
% Syntax
%   echos = USGetSnapshotResults(port)
%
%   echos = USGetSnapshotResults(port, handle)
%
% Description
%   echos = USGetSnapshotResults(port) retrieves the echos originating
%   from the ping that was sent out with USMakeSnapshot(port) for the ultrasonic 
%   sensor connected to port. In order for this to work, the sensor must
%   have been opened in snapshot mode using OpenUltrasonic(port, 'snapshot').
%
%   The last optional argument can be a valid NXT handle. If none is
%   specified, the default handle will be used (call COM_SetDefaultNXT to
%   set one).
%
%   The return-vector echos always contains exactly 8 readings for up to 
%   8 echos that were recorded from one single signal. Depending on the 
%   structure and reflections, this can only be one valid echo, or a lot of
%   interference. The values are distances, just as you'd expect from
%   GetUltrasonic. The values are sorted in order of appearance, so they
%   should also be sorted with increasing distances.
%
%   It is not known how exactly the measurements are to be interpreted!
%
%   Please make sure that after calling USGetSnapshotResults, there is a
%   little time period for the sound waves to travel, to be reflected, and
%   be recorded by the sensor. You can estimate this using the speed of
%   sound and the maximum distance you expect to measure.
%
%   *Note:* When the US sensor is opened in snapshot mode, the function
%   GetUltrasonic does not work correctly!
%
% Example
%  port = SENSOR_4;
%  OpenUltrasonic(port, 'snapshot');
%  % send out the ping
%  USMakeSnapshot(port);
%  % wait some time for the sound to travel
%  pause(0.1); % 100ms is probably too much, calculate using c_sound ;-)
%  % retrieve all the echos in 1 step
%  echos = USGetSnapshotResults(port);
%  CloseSensor(SENSOR_4);
