function out = GetSwitch(f_sensorport, varargin)
% Reads the current value of the NXT switch / touch sensor
%
% Syntax
%   switch = GetSwitch(port)
%
%   switch = GetSwitch(port, handle)
%
% Description
%   switch = GetSwitch(port) returns the current switch value switch of the NXT switch / touch
%   sensor. The measurement value switch represents the pressing mode of the switch / touch
%   sensor. true is returned if the switch / touch sensor is being pressed and false if it is
%   being released. The given port number specifies the connection port. The value port can be
%   addressed by the symbolic constants SENSOR_1, SENSOR_2, SENSOR_3 and SENSOR_4 analog to
%   the labeling on the NXT Brick.
%
%   The last optional argument can be a valid NXT handle. If none is
%   specified, the default handle will be used (call COM_SetDefaultNXT to
%   set one).
%
%   For more complex settings the function NXT_GetInputValues can be used.
%
%
% Example
%   OpenSwitch(SENSOR_4);
%   switchState = GetSwitch(SENSOR_4);
%   CloseSensor(SENSOR_4);

% We're using RAWMODE here, because BOOLEAN mode would be nice, but isn't
% really necessary. We can use the .NormalizedADVal from GetInputValues, as
% we have this variable ALLWAYS. If we were to use BOOLEAN mode, and then
% use the .ScaledVal (what we had to do in this case because that is where
% the BOOLEAN mode val is effectively stored), we'd take away ourselves the
% possibility to use PERIODCNTMODE later on to detect "taps" or something
% else. 
% Also this function would stop working if someone used NXT_SetInputMode
% with something other then BOOLEANMODE. And we certainly want to save
% the possibility to do so later on. That's why we take the
% .NormalizedADVal and compare it against the empirically found
% threshold...
