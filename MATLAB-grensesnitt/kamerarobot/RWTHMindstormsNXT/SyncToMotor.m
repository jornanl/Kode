function SyncToMotor(OtherMotor)
% Enables synchronization regulation for current active and specified motor
%  
% Syntax
%   SyncToMotor(OtherMotor) 
%
% Description
%   SyncToMotor(OtherMotor) sets the synchronization mode to the curren active motor (set by
%   SetMotor) and the given motor port OtherMotor. The value OtherMotor can be addressed by
%   the symbolic constants MOTOR_A , MOTOR_B and MOTOR_C analog to the labeling on the NXT
%   Brick. The synchronization mode can be set off if the value OtherMotor is set equal to
%   'off'. The synchronization setting takes only affect with the next SendMotorSettings command.  
%
%   This means that both motors will act as if they were connected through an axle. Motors with more
%   load on them (rough underground) will automatically be corrected and regulated for example. This
%   "synchronization regulation" is the setting you want to use when driving with your robot. Also
%   turning (SetTurnRatio) only affects motors that are synced.
%
% Note:
%   One motor can not be synchronized to itself. The synchronization mode and the speed regulation
%   mode can be set only together at one time. Once a motor is synced to another motor, all
%   settings set to it will be applied to both motors (until synchronisation is lost of course).
%   Once 2 motors are synced, you effectively control 2 motors with 1 set of commands. This means,
%   when calling SendMotorSettings, in fact 2 packets will be send to the 2 synced motors, hence
%   you will experience about twice the lag than usual. Take this into consideration...
%
%   When using several motor commands with SyncToMotor statements,
%   unexpected behaviour can occur, due to the NXTs internal error correction counters.
%   Sometimes it can help to issue the commands NXT_ResetMotorPosition(port, true),
%   NXT_ResetMotorPosition(port, false) and StopMotor(port, 'off') for each of both 
%   motors. Although this seems like a waste of packets, this can do the trick, especially
%   when working with certain turn ratios (see SetTurnRatio).
%
% Example
%   SetMotor(MOTOR_B);
%   	SyncToMotor(MOTOR_C);
%   	SetPower(76);
%   SendMotorSettings();

    % check if synced to the other other motor (^^) before:
    % what i mean: we've got 3 motors. now 1 is to be synced to another one.
    % if the this new target was synced before to the 3rd motor, we must detect
    % it now and set free the 3rd, as now the other two are synced. ok?
    % whatever, it IS necessary...

    % ok we solved the above mentioned problem very easy now:
    NXTMOTOR_State(1).SyncedToMotor = -1;
    NXTMOTOR_State(2).SyncedToMotor = -1;
    NXTMOTOR_State(3).SyncedToMotor = -1;

    % disable/overwrite speed syncing
    NXTMOTOR_State(whatmotor + 1).SyncedToSpeed = false;
    NXTMOTOR_State(OtherMotor + 1).SyncedToSpeed = false;

    % now write both states
    NXTMOTOR_State(OtherMotor + 1).SyncedToMotor = whatmotor;
    NXTMOTOR_State(whatmotor + 1).SyncedToMotor = OtherMotor;

    % copy property settings from whatmotor to OtherMotor
