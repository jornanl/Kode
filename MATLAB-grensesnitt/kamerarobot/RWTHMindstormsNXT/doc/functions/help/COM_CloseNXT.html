         <p>After using NXT handles, a user should free the device (and the memory occupied by the handle) by calling this method. After
            the clean up invoked by this call, an NXT brick can be accessed and used again (by <tt>COM_OpenNXT</tt> or <tt>COM_OpenNXTEx</tt>.

         </p>
         <p><tt>COM_CloseNXT('all')</tt> will close and erase all existing NXT devices from memory (as long as the toolbox could keep track of them). All USB handles
            will be destroyed, all open serial ports (for Bluetooth connections) will be closed. This can be useful at the beginning of
            a program to create a "fresh start" and a well-defined starting environment. Please note that a <tt>clear all</tt> command can cause this function to fail (in such a way, that not all open USB devices can be closed, since all information
            about them has be cleare from MATLAB's memory). If this happens, an NXT device might appear to be busy and cannot be used.
            Usually rebooting the NXT helps, if not try to restart MATLAB as well. So be careful with using <tt>clear all</tt> before |COM_CloseNXT('all').
         </p>

This syntax helps to avoid interference with other serial ports that might be used by other (MATLAB) programs at the same
            time. Note that still all open USB devices will be closed.
         </p>
         <h2>Limitations<a name="13"></a></h2>
         <p>If you call <tt>COM_CloseNXT('all')</tt> after a <tt>clear all</tt> command has been issued, the function will not be able to close all remaining open USB handles, since they have been cleared
            out of memory. This is a problem on Linux systems. You will not be able to use the NXT device without rebooting it. Solution:
            Either use only <tt>clear</tt> in your programs, or you use the <tt>COM_CloseNXT('all')</tt> statement before <tt>clear all</tt>. The best way however is to track your handles carefully and close them manually before exiting whenever possible!
