<p class="header">RWTH - Mindstorms NXT Toolbox</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<hr>

Welcome to the RWTH - Mindstorms NXT Toolbox for MATLAB. This toolbox is developed to control LEGO<SUP>&reg;</SUP> Mindstorms NXT robots with MATLAB via a USB and a wireless Bluetooth connection and provides MATLAB functions to interact with a robot directly.
<br><br>

The open source <a href="http://mindstorms.lego.com/Overview/NXTreme.aspx">LEGO<SUP>&reg;</SUP> Mindstorms NXT Bluetooth Developer Kit</a> containing the communication protocols to the intelligent NXT Brick are used and the main "LEGO<SUP>&reg;</SUP> Mindstorms NXT Direct Commands" are integrated.
<br><br>

This remote control concept enables you to combine robot applications with complex mathematical operations and visualizations within MATLAB.
<br><br>

So take a second to image the unlimited possibilities to give your robot artifical intelligence using the manifold MATLAB features based on the provided communication from the RWTH - Mindstorms NXT Toolbox. Have a look at the toolbox commands and be bubbling over with creative ideas to improve your robot properties with MATLAB. Have fun!

<h3>Advantages of using the RWTH - Mindstorms NXT Toolbox</h3>
(compared to programming languages operating directly on the NXT brick) 
<br>

<ul>
	<li>Huge increase in available CPU power and memory</li>
	<li>Virtually unlimited program size (compared to classic NXT programs)</li>
	<li>Control multiple robots from within one single program (only limited by the number of simultaneously installed Bluetooth adapters)</li>
	<li>Run remote MATLAB programs to observe sensors etc. while classic NXT programs are executing at the same time</li>
	<li>Use additional common hardware, e.g. webcams, joysticks, etc.</li>
	<li>Advanced debugging features are fully supported, i.e. breakpoints, step-by-step execution, on-the-fly variable inspection</li>
	<li>Enjoy the advantages of networking and internet in your robot applications</li>
	<li>Impressive and well-documented 2D- and 3D-visualization capabilities for data representation</li>
	<li>Use existing programs, toolboxes or libraries, e.g. neural networks, image processing, databases</li>
	<li>Easy-to-use MATLAB profiler to detect bottlenecks of your programs</li>
	<li>Use MATLAB's GUIDE® to easily design applications and forms using drag and drop</li>
	<li>The RWTH - Mindstorms NXT Toolbox is stable and was sucessfully tested by over 300 students using more than 75 NXT robots and 150 computers running various operating systems</li>
</ul>
