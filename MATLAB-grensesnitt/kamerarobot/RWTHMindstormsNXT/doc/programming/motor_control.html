         <p>These functions provide a very high level and simple way to access almost all motor features. The idea behind this is as follows:
            First you specify the motor number (port) you want to work with. All successive commands then affect this current motor. Once
            you are done setting everything you need, you submit these changes and issue a send command.
         </p>
         <p>Let's just walk through this</p><pre class="codeinput">SetMotor(0); <span class="comment">% first motor is active now</span>
</pre><p>This is a great opportunity to show that all of these functions accept also strings as input for numbers, i.e.:</p><pre class="codeinput">SetMotor(<span class="string">'0'</span>);
</pre><p>What's the point of this? Well, we now can use this fancy syntax:</p><pre class="codeinput">SetMotor <span class="string">0</span>
</pre><p>Another option is to use symbolic constants for port numbers, that map to easy understandable port labels just as found on
            the NXT:
         </p><pre class="codeinput">SetMotor(MOTOR_B); <span class="comment">% identical to SetMotor(1);</span>
</pre><p>In the end it's your choice which way you use to address the ports, however we recommend the usage of constants <tt>MOTOR_A</tt>, <tt>MOTOR_B</tt> and <tt>MOTOR_C</tt>.
         </p>
         <p>GetMotor just returns the motor you previously set. It can be useful when mixing <tt>NXT_</tt> functions inbetween (they need a motor port as input):
         </p><pre class="codeinput">NXT_ResetMotorPosition(GetMotor, true); <span class="comment">% good style, works with current motor</span>
</pre><p>Now the active motor is set, and we can specify all the details we want. When we're done (i.e. when the motor should finally
            start spinning), we send.
         </p><pre class="codeinput"><span class="comment">% it's nice to arrange the commands like this</span>
SetMotor <span class="string">0</span>
    SetPower <span class="string">50</span>
    AngleLimit <span class="string">360</span>
SendMotorSettings
</pre><p>Voila, motor 0 should have made a full 360&deg; turn by now...</p>
         <p>To let the motor run forever (or until you change your mind and tell it something different), use an angle limit of 0:</p><pre class="codeinput">SetMotor <span class="string">0</span>
    SetPower <span class="string">50</span>
    AngleLimit <span class="string">0</span>    <span class="comment">% run till the end of time (or battery, for that matter)</span>
SendMotorSettings
</pre><p>If we want the motor to rotate at a constant speed as accurate as possible, we have to enable speed regulation. Like all the
            other commands, this affects the currently set motor only and the settings will only be applied with the <tt>SendMotorSettings</tt> command.
         </p><pre class="codeinput">    SpeedRegulation <span class="string">on</span>
</pre><p>One noteworthy effect of the internal speed regulation is, that the motor will increase the power if the desired rotational
            speed cannot be met. Example: Consider you set a power of 20 without speed regulation, but your bot is so heavy that it does
            not move (although you can still hear the motors are trying to). If you enable speed regulation, the motor will internally
            increase its power until the wheels are moving, just like they would normally without a force acting against them. However,
            using speed regulation with a power of 100 does NOT give you more power. 100 percent is all that you can get.
         </p>
         <p>Note: SpeedRegulation seems to somehow deteriorate the motor's precision when targeting small distances (small values for
            <tt>SetAngleLimit</tt>), so use with care.
         </p>
         <p>For driving robots, the regulation mode "synchronization" is very interesting. It synchronizes two motors and they then act
            as if they were connected through an axle, so that the robot can drive straight forward. This is implemented using
         </p><pre class="codeinput">SetMotor <span class="string">1</span>
    SyncToMotor <span class="string">2</span>
    SetPower <span class="string">50</span>
SendMotorSettings
</pre><p>In the example above our bot will start driving forward (assuming motor 1 and 2 are the ones with wheels). From the point
            on where you call <tt>SyncToMotor</tt>, all settings affect both synced motors (if one of them is set active of course). Even <tt>SendMotorSettings</tt> will internally send two packets to each of the motors, so that you can use them as if they were really connected.
         </p>
         <p>Only with synced motors it is possible to drive curves or turn around:</p><pre class="codeinput">SetMotor <span class="string">1</span>
    SyncToMotor <span class="string">2</span>
    SetPower <span class="string">50</span>
    SetTurnRatio <span class="string">100</span>
    SetAngleLimit <span class="string">200</span>
SendMotorSettings
</pre><p>The turn ratio command shifts power between synced motors. 100 means one motor is spinning forward and the other backwards,
            resulting in the maximal rotational effect possible. 50 means one motor is running and the other is stopped, and with values
            bewteen 1 and 49 you can get nice curves (both wheels spinning, but not at equal speed). Needless to say, 0 results in a straight
            forward direction. You can use negative values for opposite directions (i.e. left and right turning, but that depends on the
            robot model).
         </p>
         <p>Ok, so now we want to turn off synchronisation</p><pre class="codeinput">    SyncToMotor <span class="string">off</span>
</pre><p>Note that a motor can only be synchronized to another motor <i>or</i> speed regulated at a time! We have to manually turn off synchronization, before enabling speed regulation again, and vice
            versa!
         </p><pre class="codeinput">    SyncToMotor <span class="string">off</span>
    SpeedRegulation <span class="string">on</span>
</pre><p>Note that the function <tt>StopMotor</tt> also resets motor regulation and synchronization. This is by design, see documentation.
         </p>
         <p>We've got one special setting left:</p><pre class="codeinput">    SetPower <span class="string">100</span>
    SetAngleLimit <span class="string">1080</span>
    SetRampMode <span class="string">up</span>
</pre><p>This uses the motor's runstate <tt>RAMPUP</tt>, which basically accelerates smoothly from the old power to the new power. It's only valid when you specify an angle limit.
            This is the rotational distance during which the motor will adjust the power to the new value.
         </p>
         <p>To decelerate ("brake" smoothly) use</p><pre class="codeinput">    SetPower <span class="string">0</span>
    SetAngleLimit <span class="string">1080</span>
    SetRampMode <span class="string">down</span>
</pre><p>or turn it off again (runstate <tt>RUNNING</tt>, "normal" movement), which is also the default setting:
         </p><pre class="codeinput">    SetRampMode <span class="string">off</span>
</pre><p>Once we've seen all options for the <tt>SendMotorSettings</tt>, it's worth to know that you can also access all these options with one single line.
         </p><pre class="codeinput">SendMotorSettings(MOTOR_A, 50, 360, <span class="string">'off'</span>, MOTOR_B, 25, <span class="string">'up'</span>)
</pre><p>This results in <tt>MOTOR_A</tt> being synced to <tt>MOTOR_B</tt>, both running with power 50, angle-limit 360 degrees, speed-regulation turned 'off', ramp-mode is 'up', and a turn-ratio
            of 25. Again it's your choice which way you like better, but it is <i>clearly recommended</i> to use the long version, whose syntax is better understandable.
         </p>
         <p>Ok fine. Now we've got a very handy command here:</p><pre class="codeinput">StopMotor(GetMotor, <span class="string">'off'</span>);
</pre><p>This will turn off power to the current motor, enabling the so called COAST mode, in which you can rotate the motor freely
            as you like. Of course I could've also written <tt>StopMotor(0, 'off')</tt>, but I wanted to demonstrate a possible use of <tt>GetMotor</tt> again (avoid too much hardcoding of motor numbers, or of any values at all if possible).
         </p>
         <p>The other option is</p><pre class="codeinput">StopMotor(GetMotor, <span class="string">'brake'</span>);
</pre><p>This will actively stop and hold the motor at its current position. Try moving it, it is harder than you think ;-). Works
            like an emergency brake for driving robots. It consumes quite a lot of power, so you shouldn't leave your bot in this setting
            for too much time.
         </p>
         <p>And finally we've got this handy version:</p><pre class="codeinput">StopMotor <span class="string">all</span> <span class="string">off</span> <span class="comment">% note the syntax, short for StopMotor('all', 'off')</span>
</pre><p>The parameter <tt>all</tt> is special, not just because it is turning off (or braking) all motors, but because it does so <i>at once</i>. Internally only <i>one</i> packet is sent for all three motors, so you only have to expect one third of the lag (compared to sending three packets).
            Also, you can turn off the motors almost synchronously, compared to one by one with the usual sending delay. It's a nice command
            that can very often be found at the start or end of programs to ensure all motors are turned off and don't take any power...
         </p>
         <p>So now we can control the motors, but how do we poll their rotation sensor? The answer is:</p><pre class="codeinput">out = GetMotorSettings(MOTOR_C);

<span class="comment">% so lets look into the results:</span>

out.IsRunning         <span class="comment">% boolean, true if the motor "does something"</span>
out.Power             <span class="comment">% current power</span>
out.AngleLimit        <span class="comment">% current set angle limit, 0 means none set</span>
out.TurnRatio         <span class="comment">% current turn ratio</span>

out.SpeedRegulation   <span class="comment">% boolean, speed regulated or not?</span>
out.SyncToMotor       <span class="comment">% the motor this one is synced to. -1 means not synced</span>

out.TachoCount        <span class="comment">% internal, non-resettable rotation-counter (in degrees)</span>
out.Angle             <span class="comment">% current motor position, resettable using</span>
                      <span class="comment">% ResetMotorAngle(port);</span>

out.MotorBrake        <span class="comment">% boolean, is electronic braking enabled?</span>
                      <span class="comment">%  (this has nothing to do with braking in a common</span>
                      <span class="comment">%  sense, just ignore it, should be turned on by</span>
                      <span class="comment">%  default anyway as it improves motor performance)</span>
</pre><p>This should give us all information about the motor we need. Internally a <tt>NXT_GetOutputState</tt> is used of course. Note that the <tt>.Angle</tt> value is actually the NXT internal <tt>BlockTachoCount</tt>, which you can reset using <tt>ResetMotorAngle()</tt> or <tt>NXT_ResetMotorPosition(GetMotor, true)</tt> (i.e. what is called <i>relative</i> motor position in the official Mindstorms documentation).
         </p><pre class="codeinput">ResetMotorAngle(MOTOR_A);
</pre><p>The <tt>.TachoCount</tt> on the other hand is much like your car's mileage counter. It gives the total amount of degrees the motor has rotated since
            the NXT was turned on, and it is not resettable (it will however be resetted, when a new external program is started, which
            you can enforce using <tt>NXT_StartProgram</tt>). You can also set it back to zero if you turn the motor back exactly the amount it was turned forward :-). Restarting the
            NXT brick is a more comfortable way...
         </p>
         <p>We have got yet one more very handy function for you. Suppose you've just set your motor to run a certain distance, i.e. using</p><pre class="codeinput">SetMotor <span class="string">0</span>
    SetPower <span class="string">20</span>
    SetAngleLimit <span class="string">360</span>
SendMotorSettigns
</pre><p>Now power 20 is not very fast, so it will take some time for the motor until it has reached its angle limit. But how do you
            know when it's done? You could create a loop and constantly call <tt>GetMotorSettings</tt> to check wether <tt>.IsRunning</tt> is set or not. And this is exactly what <tt>WaitForMotor</tt> does.
         </p><pre class="codeinput">SetMotor <span class="string">0</span>
    SetPower <span class="string">20</span>
    SetAngleLimit <span class="string">360</span>
SendMotorSettigns

WaitForMotor(GetMotor) <span class="comment">% you've seen me using GetMotor before...</span>

<span class="comment">% if this WaitForMotor was not here, we would send the</span>
<span class="comment">% PlaySound command DIRECTLY after starting the motor!</span>
<span class="comment">% Try it for yourself. Basically our Matlab is "blocked" now and holds</span>
<span class="comment">% execution, until the motor is done...</span>

NXT_PlaySound(440, 200)
</pre><p>This will play a short beep on the NXT immediately after the motor has reached its angle limit. Of course that does <i>not</i> mean that the motor has stopped already: It's currently in coast mode and will keep turning a short while. That is why, the
            following commands sequence is often used to try to stop at a certain position:
         </p><pre class="codeinput"><span class="comment">% ...</span>
SendMotorSettigns
WaitForMotor(GetMotor)
StopMotor(GetMotor, <span class="string">'brake'</span>) <span class="comment">% actively hold still</span>
pause(1) <span class="comment">% do so for a short while</span>
<span class="comment">% active braking has a high power consumption, so:</span>
StopMotor(GetMotor, <span class="string">'off'</span>) <span class="comment">% release motor</span>
</pre><p><tt>WaitForMotor</tt> has one more parameter that you can use. Imagine what happens with this code snippet:
         </p><pre class="codeinput">SetMotor <span class="string">0</span>
    SetPower <span class="string">20</span>
    SetAngleLimit <span class="string">0</span> <span class="comment">% 0 means no angle limit = run forever</span>
SendMotorSettigns
WaitForMotor(GetMotor)
</pre><p>See it? You've created an endless loop. Matlab will block till the end of time (or battery in this case), as the motor will
            not stop. Why should it, it has no angle limit set.
         </p>
         <p>Something else can happen: You can set an angle limit, let's say a certain distance for a driving robot. But there is a wall,
            the bot can't go any further, and again: Endless loop, because the motor will not reach its angle limit.
         </p>
         <p>The solution for this is a built-in timeout. Try:</p><pre class="codeinput">WaitForMotor(GetMotor, 10)
</pre><p>or use this syntax if you like it better:</p><pre class="codeinput">WaitForMotor <span class="string">0</span> <span class="string">10</span>
</pre><p>This time the function will only block for a maximum of 10 seconds. If the motor is done earlier, fine. Then the function
            will exit of course. But if it got stuck or is in an endless loop, after the timeout period (you can use fractions by the
            way, like 5.7) <tt>WaitForMotor</tt> will continue execution. The price for avoiding this endless loop / Matlab block: When specifying a timeout, you cannot be
            sure that the motor really has stopped, or wether it timed out. So take care of the consequences on your own (e.g. by reading
            <tt>.Angle</tt> to see wether the specified angle limit was met, or by checking <tt>.IsRunning</tt> to see if the motor is still blocked)...
         </p>
         <p>The motor ports can also be used for other actuators besides the NXT motors. Lamps can be connected, too. The following function
            can be used to turn the lamp  on and a short while later off.
         </p><pre class="codeinput">SwitchLamp(MOTOR_C, <span class="string">'on'</span>);
pause(1)
SwitchLamp(MOTOR_C, <span class="string">'off'</span>);
</pre><p>It is also possible to use 'all' as port-number, just like you've seen for <tt>StopMotor</tt>:
         </p><pre class="codeinput">SwitchLamp <span class="string">all</span> <span class="string">off</span>
</pre><p>There is no secret behind <tt>SwitchLamp</tt> - it just sets power 100 for the specific output port. You could have used <tt>SendMotorSettings</tt> as well, but <tt>SwitchLamp</tt> is easier in this case and better to understand.
         </p>

    SetRampMode off
    
%%
% Once we've seen all options for the |SendMotorSettings|, it's worth to
% know that you can also access all these options with one single line.

SendMotorSettings(MOTOR_A, 50, 360, 'off', MOTOR_B, 25, 'up')

%%
% This results in |MOTOR_A| being synced to |MOTOR_B|, both running with power
% 50, angle-limit 360 degrees, speed-regulation turned 'off', ramp-mode is
% 'up', and a turn-ratio of 25.
% Again it's your choice which way you like better, but it is _clearly
% recommended_ to use the long version, whose syntax is better
% understandable.
%

    
%%
% Ok fine. Now we've got a very handy command here:

StopMotor(GetMotor, 'off');

%%
% This will turn off power to the current motor, enabling the so called
% COAST mode, in which you can rotate the motor freely as you like.
% Of course I could've also written |StopMotor(0, 'off')|, but I wanted to
% demonstrate a possible use of |GetMotor| again (avoid too much hardcoding of
% motor numbers, or of any values at all if possible).
%
% The other option is 

StopMotor(GetMotor, 'brake');

%%
% This will actively stop and hold the motor at its current position. Try
% moving it, it is harder than you think ;-). Works like an emergency brake
% for driving robots. It consumes quite a lot of power, so you shouldn't
% leave your bot in this setting for too much time.
%
% And finally we've got this handy version:

StopMotor all off % note the syntax, short for StopMotor('all', 'off')

%%
% The parameter |all| is special, not just because it is turning off (or
% braking) all motors, but because it does so _at once_. Internally only
% _one_ packet is sent for all three motors, so you only have to expect one
% third of the lag (compared to sending three packets). Also, you can turn
% off the motors almost synchronously, compared to one by one with the
% usual sending delay. It's a nice command that can very often be found at
% the start or end of programs to ensure all motors are turned off and don't take any power...
%
% So now we can control the motors, but how do we poll their rotation
% sensor? The answer is:

out = GetMotorSettings(MOTOR_C);

% so lets look into the results:
                   
out.IsRunning         % boolean, true if the motor "does something"
out.Power             % current power
out.AngleLimit        % current set angle limit, 0 means none set
out.TurnRatio         % current turn ratio

out.SpeedRegulation   % boolean, speed regulated or not?
out.SyncToMotor       % the motor this one is synced to. -1 means not synced

out.TachoCount        % internal, non-resettable rotation-counter (in degrees)
out.Angle             % current motor position, resettable using
                      % ResetMotorAngle(port);

out.MotorBrake        % boolean, is electronic braking enabled?
                      %  (this has nothing to do with braking in a common
                      %  sense, just ignore it, should be turned on by
                      %  default anyway as it improves motor performance)

                      
                      
%%
% This should give us all information about the motor we need. Internally a
% |NXT_GetOutputState| is used of course. Note that the |.Angle| value is
% actually the NXT internal |BlockTachoCount|, which you can reset using
% |ResetMotorAngle()| or |NXT_ResetMotorPosition(GetMotor, true)| 
% (i.e. what is called _relative_ motor position in the official Mindstorms documentation).
%

ResetMotorAngle(MOTOR_A);


%%
% The |.TachoCount| on the other hand is much like your car's mileage
% counter. It gives the total amount of degrees the motor has rotated since
% the NXT was turned on, and it is not resettable (it will however be resetted, when a 
% new external program is started, which you can enforce using |NXT_StartProgram|). 
% You can also set it back to zero if you turn the motor back exactly the amount it was turned forward
% :-). Restarting the NXT brick is a more comfortable way...

%%
% We have got yet one more very handy function for you. Suppose you've just
% set your motor to run a certain distance, i.e. using

SetMotor 0
    SetPower 20
    SetAngleLimit 360
SendMotorSettigns

%%
% Now power 20 is not very fast, so it will take some time for the motor
% until it has reached its angle limit. But how do you know when it's done?
% You could create a loop and constantly call |GetMotorSettings| to check
% wether |.IsRunning| is set or not. And this is exactly what
% |WaitForMotor| does.
%

SetMotor 0
    SetPower 20
    SetAngleLimit 360
SendMotorSettigns

WaitForMotor(GetMotor) % you've seen me using GetMotor before...

% if this WaitForMotor was not here, we would send the
% PlaySound command DIRECTLY after starting the motor!
% Try it for yourself. Basically our Matlab is "blocked" now and holds
% execution, until the motor is done...

NXT_PlaySound(440, 200)

%%
% This will play a short beep on the NXT immediately after the motor has
% reached its angle limit. Of course that does _not_ mean that the motor
% has stopped already: It's currently in coast mode and will keep turning a
% short while. That is why, the following commands sequence is often used
% to try to stop at a certain position:

% ...
SendMotorSettigns
WaitForMotor(GetMotor)
StopMotor(GetMotor, 'brake') % actively hold still
pause(1) % do so for a short while
% active braking has a high power consumption, so:
StopMotor(GetMotor, 'off') % release motor

%%
% |WaitForMotor| has one more
% parameter that you can use. Imagine what happens with this code snippet:

SetMotor 0
    SetPower 20
    SetAngleLimit 0 % 0 means no angle limit = run forever
SendMotorSettigns
WaitForMotor(GetMotor)

%%
% See it? You've created an endless loop. Matlab will block till the end of
% time (or battery in this case), as the motor will not stop. Why should
% it, it has no angle limit set.
%
% Something else can happen: You can set an angle limit, let's say a certain 
% distance for a driving robot. But there is a wall, the bot can't go any
% further, and again: Endless loop, because the motor will not reach its
% angle limit.
%
% The solution for this is a built-in timeout. Try:

WaitForMotor(GetMotor, 10)

%%
% or use this syntax if you like it better:
WaitForMotor 0 10

%%
% This time the function will only block for a maximum of 10 seconds. If
% the motor is done earlier, fine. Then the function will exit of course.
% But if it got stuck or is in an endless loop, after the timeout period
% (you can use fractions by the way, like 5.7) |WaitForMotor| will continue
% execution. The price for avoiding this endless loop / Matlab block: When
% specifying a timeout, you cannot be sure that the motor really has
% stopped, or wether it timed out. So take care of the consequences on
% your own (e.g. by reading |.Angle| to see wether the specified angle limit
% was met, or by checking |.IsRunning| to see if the motor is still blocked)...

%%
% The motor ports can also be used for other actuators besides the NXT
% motors. Lamps can be connected, too. The following function can be
% used to turn the lamp  on and a short while later off.

SwitchLamp(MOTOR_C, 'on');
pause(1)
SwitchLamp(MOTOR_C, 'off');

%%
% It is also possible to use 'all' as port-number, just like you've seen
% for |StopMotor|:

SwitchLamp all off

%%
% There is no secret behind |SwitchLamp| - it just sets power 100 for the
% specific output port. You could have used |SendMotorSettings| as well,
% but |SwitchLamp| is easier in this case and better to understand.
