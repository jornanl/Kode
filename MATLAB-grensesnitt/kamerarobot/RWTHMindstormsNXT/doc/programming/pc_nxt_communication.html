         <h2>Bluetooth connections and serial handles<a name="3"></a></h2>
         <p>To communicate with the NXT via bluetooth, we have to use the SPP (serial port profile), which basically works like a virtual
            serial port. This is why we can send and receive data from within MATLAB through the serial port commands.
         </p>
         <p>To handle different connections or bluetooth adapters on different computers easily, a certain ini-file with settings for
            the MATLAB functions must be present in the current directory (or one that can be found through path settings).
         </p>
         <p>The ini-file format looks like this</p><pre>[Bluetooth]</pre><pre>SerialPort=COM3
BaudRate=57600
DataBits=8</pre><pre>SendSendPause=10
SendReceivePause=30</pre><pre>TimeOut=2</pre><p>The serial settings should be self explaining. Explanation of the send-pause-values will follow later on. The <tt>TimeOut</tt> parameter only has an effect when using Windows. It sets the period the bluetooth stack should wait when it is "missing data".
            The MATLAB-internal default value of 10 causes annoying freezes in certain robot programs on certain computers (a direct cause
            is not yet found). By setting 2 (the toolbox default value), one should get a fairly stable experience with very rare execution
            pauses of 2 seconds. Smaller timeout values can lead to real packet loss which has not been examined yet.
         </p>
         <p>To create a bluetooth configuration ini-file, a standard editor can be used. A more comfortable way is to use the GUI-guided
            program:
         </p><pre class="codeinput">COM_MakeBTConfigFile;
</pre><p>The following functions work under Windows as well as Linux, with one big exception: The returned handle will be a <tt>serial</tt> struct in Windows, but a simple scalar file handle in Linux. All the internal functions take care of this, but if you should
            want to access fields like <tt>.BytesAvailable</tt> of the handle, you can only do so in Windows, i.e. you must check the operating system using <tt>if ispc</tt> to avoid errors in Linux.
         </p>
         <p>Now first have a look how to obtain a handle to a bluetooth connection.</p><pre class="codeinput"><span class="comment">% Before we open a handle, we clean up to avoid errors:</span>
COM_CloseNXT(<span class="string">'all'</span>, <span class="string">'bluetooth.ini'</span>);

<span class="comment">% This only closes all open serial ports matching the COM-port from the</span>
<span class="comment">% ini-file. More drastical is to close all open COM-ports like this:</span>
COM_CloseNXT(<span class="string">'all'</span>);
</pre><p>Now we can open a connection. Make sure the bluetooth dongle is connected to the NXT brick (using the according software or
            scripts) before calling this.
         </p><pre class="codeinput">h = COM_OpenNXT(<span class="string">'bluetooth.ini'</span>, <span class="string">'check'</span>);
</pre><p>The optional argument <tt>'check'</tt> causes the function so send a keep-alive-packet and to wait for the answer before returning a valid handle. This is very
            comfortable as it detects a malfunctioning / closed bluetooth connection before the execution of other program code.
         </p>
         <p>Set the global default handle, so that later on, whenever we're calling functions, we don't have to pass the handle every
            time.
         </p><pre class="codeinput">COM_SetDefaultNXT(h);

<span class="comment">% This is self-explanatory</span>
handle = COM_GetDefaultNXT;
</pre><p>To close an open connection / handle, just call</p><pre class="codeinput">COM_CloseNXT(h);

<span class="comment">% although this would also do the trick:</span>
COM_CloseNXT(<span class="string">'all'</span>, <span class="string">'bluetooth.ini'</span>);
</pre><h2>Sending and receiving data<a name="10"></a></h2>
         <p>In this section we've got:</p>
         <div>
            <ul>
               <li><tt>COM_CreatePacket</tt></li>
               <li><tt>COM_SendPacket</tt></li>
               <li><tt>COM_CollectPacket</tt></li>
            </ul>
         </div>
         <p>These functions are very "low level" and you should usually not use them on your own, unless you're implementing new NXT functions.
            All the already implemented NXT functions make use of these.
         </p>
         <p>First we've got</p><pre class="codeinput">packet = COM_CreatePacket(CommandType, Command, ReplyMode, ContentBytes);
</pre><p>where ReplyMode either has to be 'reply' or 'dontreply', specifying wether we want an answer from the NXT or not. This command
            essentially creates the binary data for a packet, taking care of payload size and similar things. For more details see inside
            the "Bluetooth Engine Demo" file.
         </p>
         <p>Now it's getting interesting. We've got two functions to send and receive data respectively. Because the LEGO NXT brick has
            a 30ms latency when switching from transmit to receive mode, we can expect a 60ms latency for a whole sensor reading request.
         </p>
         <p>Very important is that the NXT can apparently lose packets / commands, because the input buffer (or queue) is of limited size.
            As we do not know any more details about this, the send and receive functions have the option to wait between subsequent send
            operations (i.e. to be less "aggressive"). This is where the earlier mentioned settings from the ini file come in:
         </p><pre>SendSendPause=10
SendReceivePause=30</pre><p>In this case we demand a 10ms delay between two consecutive send operations. On the other hand, a 30ms pause is required between
            each send and receive operation (and vice versa receive and send). This should give the NXT enough time so switch between
            bluetooth transmission modes without loosing any packets.
         </p>
         <p>Note: The functions are "intelligent" and only pause execution if it is necessary. So if you only try to send a packet once
            every second, you will not notice this automatic delay, as it is not required.
         </p><pre class="codeinput"><span class="comment">% for this function, we always have to specify a valid serial port handle</span>
COM_SendPacket(packet, handle);
</pre><p>Receiving packets is as easy. Make sure you have requested one before you try to collect something.</p><pre class="codeinput">[type cmd statusbyte content] = COM_CollectPacket(handle);
</pre><p>The statusbyte will be checked automatically by this function, and if it contains an error message, an according warning will
            be issued. You can disable the automatic status byte check by calling <tt>COM_CollectPacket(handle, 'dontcheck')</tt>. There is really just one special situation where this is needed: <tt>NXT_LSGetStatus</tt> (see documentation and function code).
         </p>
         <p><tt>COM_CollectPacket</tt> exactly retrieves one packet from the internal receive buffer. It does so by checking the length of the packet (first two
            bytes) and then only reads the amount of data that belongs to this specific packet. Be very careful though: If you call it
            without previously requesting data, there will be nothing to collect, hence the function will return nothing after a timeout
            or crash, depending on your bluetooth adapter. Even worse, under Linux it will block without the possibility to break until
            you physically turn off the bluetooth device.

%  
%  TimeOut=2
%
% The serial settings should be self explaining. Explanation of the

%
% Now first have a look how to obtain a handle to a bluetooth connection.

% Before we open a handle, we clean up to avoid errors:
COM_CloseNXT('all', 'bluetooth.ini');

% This only closes all open serial ports matching the COM-port from the
% ini-file. More drastical is to close all open COM-ports like this:
COM_CloseNXT('all');

%%
% Now we can open a connection. Make sure the bluetooth dongle is connected
% to the NXT brick (using the according software or scripts) before calling this.
h = COM_OpenNXT('bluetooth.ini', 'check');
%%
% The optional argument |'check'| causes the function so send a

%%
% Set the global default handle, so that later on, whenever we're calling

COM_SetDefaultNXT(h);

% This is self-explanatory
handle = COM_GetDefaultNXT;

%%
% To close an open connection / handle, just call
COM_CloseNXT(h);

% although this would also do the trick:
COM_CloseNXT('all', 'bluetooth.ini');


%% Sending and receiving data
% In this section we've got:
%%
% * |COM_CreatePacket|
% * |COM_SendPacket|
% * |COM_CollectPacket|
%%
% These functions are very "low level" and you should usually not use them

%%
% First we've got

% for this function, we always have to specify a valid serial port handle
COM_SendPacket(packet, handle);

%%
% Receiving packets is as easy. Make sure you have requested one before you
% try to collect something.
[type cmd statusbyte content] = COM_CollectPacket(handle);

%%
% The statusbyte will be checked automatically by this function, and if it
% contains an error message, an according warning will be issued. You can 
% disable the automatic status byte check by calling
